# Hi there neighbor and/or friend! :D
If you're reading this, you are someone I care about and I want you to live a long, happy, and healthy life. 

There is an ongoing crisis that heightens inequality and is being widely ignored globally. We must actively fight systemic injustices and the systems that uphold them. 
Just like how we openly discuss issues of income inequality, racial discrimination, and gender prejudices, there is another inequality that must be addressed: Public health and clean air. 

Please consider the following...

- COVID / Long Covid will cause issues later in life
    - Your COVID infection 3 years ago [is as dangerous as having a stroke today (WashU)](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/covid-can-cause-new-health-problems-3-years-after-infection/).
    - Sure we’ve made mistakes in the past, but that isn’t an excuse to keep making them! 
        - Repeat infections are increasingly [bad for you](https://www.self.com/story/covid-reinfection-health-effects).
    - COVID damages your immune system
        - Common mistake is thinking that avoiding viruses will cause [“immune debt”](https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1733). 
        - Getting Flu and Covid-19 “are not going to help you develop a healthy immune system”
            - Avoiding Flu and Covid-19 ["is a priority"](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/is-the-hygiene-hypothesis-true). 
            - Covid-19 can actually damage [multiple organs in your body](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11834749/), even if your infection is asymptomatic.
    - To protect the community you love:
        - We must weaken the [chain of transmission](https://newlevant.com/COVIDzine)!
    - Long Covid is a global problem
        - This is an issue [around the world](https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaf533), and we can find the solution: Clean air
        - [Amazing podcast discussing how we can improve public health](https://www.publichealthisdead.com/episodes/somethings-in-the-air).

In the past, [doctors did not regularly wash their hands](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9632745/) and attempting to escape slavery was [considered a mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania). As society learns and grows, we must leave behind the mistakes of the past! 

The Covid-19 pandemic has not ended. It continues to disable, kill, and evolve. 
We have solutions brewing, though! (does that count as a chemistry pun?)

- Canadian organizations have proposed respirator masks as a [healthcare standard, and the World Health Organization supports this](https://whn.global/whn-response-to-canadas-csa-z94-4-25-respirator-standard/)!
- Around the globe, [Mask Blocs](https://maskbloc.org/) have formed to provide local community support, mutual aid, and information
- As viruses evolve, our vaccines do to! Nuvaxovid is the latest version of Novavax, which provides long-term support for you against some of the current active strains.

Remember the [Swiss Cheese Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model) and [its importance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8514562/). Vaccines are important, quality respirator masks are important, and air filtration is also important.

With love,
