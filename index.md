Hi! 

Jisp is a streamer and game dev, interested in how different games use storytelling and/or competition to bring people together!

You can find me:

- Making games with [HoneyCo](https://www.honeycogames.com/),

- Or streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/JispGames)!

I also have [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/jispgames.bsky.social). 

Thanks for reading, neighbor! :D
